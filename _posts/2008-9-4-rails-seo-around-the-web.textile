While Ruby on Rails specific SEO(Search Engine Optimization) is a pretty small subject, compared to the larger world of SEO, it still requires some thought. 

Over at "http://www.bingocardcreator.com/rails-seo-tips.htm":http://www.bingocardcreator.com/rails-seo-tips.htm is a very large article on Rails-specific optimizations you can do to improve search engine rankings. 

It includes:
* The Case Study: Daily Bingo Cards
* On-page Optimization
* Sexy URLs, or, Default Routes Considered Harmful
* Taming Your Title Tags (And Other Metadata)
* Don't Repeat Yourself... In Your Content
* Off-page Optimization
* acts_as_linkbait: making it easy to link to you
* Bookmarks, Chicklets, and Permalinks, Oh My!

Some of the topics have been covered here at "SEOonRails.com":http://www.seoonrails.com/ but it's always nice to get another angle on it as there is always more than one way to do something when it comes to programming.
