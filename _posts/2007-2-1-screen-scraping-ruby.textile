I'm not going to make a full post on this because over on Rubyrailways.com they have an "excellent post":http://www.rubyrailways.com/data-extraction-for-web-20-screen-scraping-in-rubyrails covering the main libraries for screen scraping in ruby.

However it is a bit out of date being 7 months old, and since then 2 more excellent libraries have emerged. 

"Hpricot":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ from the Ruby Superstar "_why":http://redhanded.hobix.com/ which has just been updated to version 0.5 *today*!

And "Scrapi":http://rubyforge.org/projects/scrapi which is also excellent.
