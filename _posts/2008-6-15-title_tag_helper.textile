I've come across a small, but very useful plugin for Ruby on Rails applications. 
It was designed with SEO in mind, and it makes keeping your meta title tags, and your &lt;h1> tags in sync easy. 

The plugin is hosted at (the very awesome) GitHub : "http://github.com/DefV/title_helper/tree/master":http://github.com/DefV/title_helper/tree/master

Here's how it works.

In your application layout you call the plugin, passing in your overall site title. 

<pre><code>
<title><%= title :site_name => "The SEO on Rails Blog" %></title>
</code></pre>

If you do nothing else, all pages on your site will have the title "Seo on Rails". 

In your view templates, say app/views/blogpost/view.html.erb you could have this:
<pre><code>
<%= title "SEO plugins for Ruby on Rails" %>
</code></pre>

This will print out a H1 tag:
<macro:code lang="html">
<h1>SEO plugins for Ruby on Rails</h1>
</code></pre>
At the same time, the plugin will remember the title and insert it into the layout's &lt;title> tag before your :site_name. 
In our example that would result in :
<macro:code lang="html">
<tiitle>SEO plugins for Ruby on Rails - The SEO on Rails Blog</title>
</code></pre>

Keeping your  &lt;H1> tags and your  &lt;title> tags in sync is a *good thing*, and this plugin helps make it very easy.
