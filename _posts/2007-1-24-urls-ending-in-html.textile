This is just a personal preference of mine, but I like to have URLs end in .html. Fortunately rails makes this easy:

In your routes file:

<pre><code>
map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.html', :format => 'html'
</code></pre>

For your other custom routes you will need to also add :format => 'html' and the .html at the end of the route line like above.

*Update*

Another (better?) way to achieve nice URLs in rails, with .html suffixes is to add the following to your ApplicationController:
<pre><code>
  def default_url_options(options)
    { :format => 'html' }
  end
</code></pre>

This means your routing line is much cleaner. In fact it's the default!

<pre><code>
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
</code></pre>
